# jupyter_browser_clipboard
Copy text to OS clipboard when using Jupyter remotely. This uses the web browser's
own clipboard via Javascript.

Originally a gist on github but got tired of copy pasting it into each notebooks.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/bsdz/jupyter_browser_clipboard.git#main
```
